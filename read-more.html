                <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
                <p>While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these feelings
                    intensely,
                    for
                    long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent
                    reason.
                    Depression
                    is
                    more than just a low mood – it's a serious condition that affects your physical and mental
                    health.</p>
                <p>Depression is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the
                    way
                    you
                    think,
                    and how you act.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
            <p>We actually don’t know exactly what causes depression. A number of things are often linked to its
                development. Depression usually results from a combination of recent events and other
                longer-term or
                personal factors, rather than one immediate issue or event. Some of these factors include;</p>

                    <li>Mild depression</li>

                <li>Major depresive disorder with psychotic features</li>

                    <h2>Stages of depression</h2>
                    <p>There is no a particularly developed model to depict the stages of depression. Specialists have
                        adopted
                        the stages of grief model.</p>
                    <p>These are:</p>
                    <h4>Denial and Anger</h4>

                    <p>When you have a feeling of intense sadness and you ignore this as a problem.This should be fairly
                        short
                        lived. ou may feel intense anger that you are going through this difficult time, and see no way
                        out of
                        the depression. You may go into a phase of thinking about "why me" and wanting to fight an inner
                        demon
                        that in reality is just another version of yourself.</p>

                    <h4>Bargaining</h4>

                    <p>Once depression has advanced, the illness becomes almost like another entity. The depression
                        tells you
                        horrible things about yourself and what is going on in the world around you. And, tired of
                        feeling this
                        way, you begin to bargain with it. You try to issue ultimatums and negotiations trying to stave
                        off the
                        thoughts brought on by the depression in favor of something more positive. Unfortunately, this
                        is rarely
                        successful, and the negative thoughts or the entity of depression invariably wins out, leading
                        to the
                        next stage.</p>

                    <h4>Depression</h4>
                    <p>When you are in the depths of the depression, you may feel a though you are lost in a wilderness
                        from
                        which you cannot escape. The depression may completely overtake you and make you feel as though
                        you will
                        never be happy again. During this stage of your depression, you will have obsessive and racing
                        thoughts
                        that are debilitating in nature. These thoughts will further perpetuate the depression, making
                        you quite
                        desperate.</p>

                    <h4>Acceptance</h4>
                    <p>Finally, you have to come to accept the depression. You seek help, and you do the work in therapy
                        and
                        take the medications you are prescribed. You begin to feel better. You may fear a relapse, but
                        eventually, you come to recognize that although relapse is possible, you have to accept that as
                        something the might happen, but not dwell on the possibility.</p>
