            <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
            <p class="def">While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these
                feelings
                intensely,
                for
                long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent
                reason.
                Depression
                is
                more than just a low mood – it's a serious condition that affects your physical and mental
                health.</p>
            <p class="def">Depression is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the
                way
                you
                think,
                and how you act.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
            <p class="causes">We actually don’t know exactly what causes depression. A number of things are often linked to its
                development. Depression usually results from a combination of recent events and other
                longer-term or
                personal factors, rather than one immediate issue or event. Some of these factors include;</p>
